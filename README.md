## Hello there! ✌️

My name is Raven and I'm a conversions specialist and generalist marketer/designer here to make open source a little bit more user friendly. I'm obsessed with marketing sites/landing pages, product design, and helping get products into the market! 

You might not see me directly contribute to repositories much, but as things I've designed roll out I'll post on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/amnotadev) and update this readme with the projects I consider worth mentioning. 

[ Coming soon ]
